complementary rule
P(A') = 1 - P(A)

Addition rule
event a and event b are mutually exclusive
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)

even a and even b are not mutually exclusive
P(a U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(a ^ B)

multiplication rule
events are dependent
p(A^B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)

events are independent
P(A^B) = P(A)P(B)

random variables and probability distribution
discrete random variable
    - finite set of real numbers as its possible values.

continuous random variables 
    - on that has a range consisting of an interval (finite or infinite) of real numbers
    - maraming decimal point

probability distribution
p(x) = P(X=x)
given
0 <= p(x) <=1
sum of P(X=x) = 1

Cumulative distribution function
F(b) = P(X <= b)
